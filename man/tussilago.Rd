\description{phenotypic integration example dataset from Torices & Méndez (2014).}
\usage{data(tussilago)}
\details{This data set represents the dry mass (in grames) of inflorescence components of the sunflower species \emph{Tussilago farfara}. The inflorescences were dissected in 'SCAPE', 'RECEPTACLE', 'MALEFL' (male flowers), 'OVAR' (reproductive part of female flowers), and 'RAYS' (the petaloid ray of female flower). Furthermore in the last column the total weight of the inflorescence is added 'TOTALSIZE'.}
